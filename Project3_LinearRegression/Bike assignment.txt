Requirement of the problem statement
1. problem is less demand of the bikes
2. need tppredict the bike demand 
3. need to find relationship between demand and explaratory variables
4. need to create a linear model that affects the demand

Details.
1.categorical datatype : column- 
Season-->change label (1-spring,2-summer,3-fall,4-winter)
month-->categorical column(need to do barplots, value count) (1-Jan,2-Feb.........)
WeekDay-->Categorical column (2-wednesday, 1-tuesday)
Weathersit--> categorical (1-clear, 2-misty, 3-light snow/rain, 4- heavy snow/haeavy rain)
Year--> Binary column(0-2018, 1-2019)
Holiday--> Binary(0-no holiday, 1-Holiday)
Workingday--> Binary(1-workingday, 0 no working day)
humidity--> numeric column, let it be, keep it as float
windspeed --> numeric column, let it be, keep it as float
cnt-->target variable
casual-->unregistered, drop this
registered--> from the app, drop this
date--> drop this
instant--> drop this as well
2. tempurature & adjusted temperature are highly corelated, drop one of them, or combine them


<-->Data vizualidation,
1.Perform EDA(univariate, bivariate)
2.Check corelation between variables)


<-->Data preperation
1. create dummy variables
2. divide train and test
3. perform scaling 
4. divide data into x & y


<-->Data Modelling & evaluation:
1.we will get 50 features(after creating dummy variables)
2.do RFE and get top 15
3. then do manual elemination, cehcking one by onr
4.calculate r2 and adjusted r2 (upto 80~85%)
5 test set will give 75%
6. r2 and adjusted r2 diffrence should not be more than 5%
7. check all the things(no of variables ~= 10, VIF should be kess than 5, pvalue should be less than 5, residual analysis, check adjusted r2 for both test and train set)

<-->Check asumptions for residual analysis

1. calculate error, then plot distribution plot , mean should be 0 and dtandard deviation should be 1
2. error terma are independent, plot a scatter plot for the error terms
3. check if the error terms have constant variance(homoscedasticity), we use scatter ploy (y train pred vs error)
